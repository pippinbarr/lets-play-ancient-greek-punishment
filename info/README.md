## Description
*You can do it Sisyphus! Be the boulder! Keep on rollin’! Don’t stop! Never give up! No retreat! No surrender! No end in sight! Just delicious Greek torment as far as the eye can see and as fast as the fingers can type!*

(Note that the above cutesy description is no longer quite accurate since I've "upgraded" the game to work with mobile and now you click the mouse or tap the screen to labour away in your punishments. Oh well.)

## Description
Originally released on 30 November 2011, *Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment* was written in ActionScript 3 using Adobe's FlashBuilder 4.5 and the excellent [Flixel](http://www.flixel.org/) library.

The new playable version has been ported to JavaScript using the equally excellent [Phaser](https://phaser.io) game framework. It uses sound effects made in [bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/). The font in *Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment* is [Commodore 64 Pixelized](http://www.dafont.com/commodore-64-pixelized.font) by [Devin Cook](http://www.devincook.com/). If you're really, really paying attention, you might notice that the hill for Sisyphus differs a little from the original game in that it shows a plateau. I decided I like it that way more.
