# Design Journal

This "design journal" is made up of posts I wrote on my public-facing blog while making *Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment* back in 2011.

## Intermittently Yours (2011-12-23)

A tiny bit redundant to point this out now, but this blog is currently in a bit of an involuntary hibernation. You know, like &#8220;narcosleepy&#8221;. Basically I got slammed by the end of the teaching year, giving a talk in Spain, and then travel to New Zealand. Oh, and laziness. Got slammed by that too.

I am getting some stuff done in the background here. A new game based on tales of mythical Greek punishments and philosophy. Another new game based on an internet meme. And another interactive thing in collaboration with a New Zealand artist. Plus my book was published in New Zealand &#8211; more on that experience later.

Anyway, the theory is to get back to this blog, a little gingerly, over the next few days, and back into production mode in the new year.
